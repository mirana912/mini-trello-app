Initial Prompt for Frontend

Project: Real-Time Board Management Tool ( Mini Trello App )

Overview:

Develop a real-time card management tool that enables teams to collaborate on cards, track tasks, and monitor progress in real-time. The application should support multiple users, card creation, task assignment, a drag-and-drop task management feature, and dynamic updates across all connected users.

Idea: Create a responsive web application with React.js and real-time updates with WebSocket technology.

1. Card Setup:
* Initialize a new React.js card using Create React App or another preferred method. (You are also welcome to set up the app using Next.js or Vite instead of Create-React-App.)
* Set up card dependencies, including libraries for routing, state management, and real-time updates (e.g., WebSocket library).
2. Authentication:
    * Connect authentication components to backend API endpoints (/auth/signup, /auth/signing).
3. Dashboard Design:
    * Design a dashboard layout using a responsive grid system (e.g., CSS Grid, Bootstrap grid).
    * Create navigation components for accessing different sections of the application (e.g., cards, profile).
    * Implement dynamic rendering of user-specific content based on authentication status.

4. Card Management:
    * Design and implement a card listing interface displaying all cards associated with the authenticated user.
    * Add options for creating new cards and displaying card details.
    * Integrate CRUD functionality for cards (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with backend API endpoints (/cards, /cards/:id).

5. Task Management:
    * Develop task management components within each card, including task lists and task detail views.
    * Implement functionality for creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
    * Integrate real-time updates for task lists using WebSocket technology to reflect changes made by other users.
    * Add features for task assignment, priority setting, deadline tracking, and status updates.
    * Use a library like React DnD (Drag and Drop for React) to handle drag-and-drop interactions.
    * Configure draggable and droppable areas within the card interface.
    * Enable users to drag tasks from one location to another, such as between task lists or within a card board ( You can create some default status card boards like icebox, backlog, on going, waiting for review, done).
    * 
6. List Users
    * Create a list users component for viewing and editing to manage account settings.
    * Connect profile components to backend API endpoints for updating user information (/users/:id).

7. Styling and UI Enhancements:
    * Apply consistent styling using CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Material UI) or CSS preprocessors (e.g., Sass, Less).
    * Implement responsive design principles to ensure the application is usable across different devices and screen sizes.
    * Enhance user experience with animations, transitions, and interactive elements.
